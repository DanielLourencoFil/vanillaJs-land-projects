## Vanilla Javascript projects page

"All big things are made of small things"
This is a principle that has guided me on all I've made and built in my life.
It is true to whatever human action, from crafts to relationships...

On this page, I'm registering my progress in my learning journey in the fundamental building blocks of webdevelopment, namelly, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It contains the best projects that I coded in order to master the main concepts of those tools.
Some of them are made due my own inspiration, and some are inspired by chalenges proposed on the courses I took. The final result contains my solution to them, with my code to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
